1. Name of the Project
Event Guest Manager

2. Description
Event Guest Manager is a console-based Python application that helps event organizers register events and manage guest lists. Guests can RSVP to multiple events, and each event can have multiple guests â€” making this a many-to-many relationship. The system uses SQLAlchemy to handle database operations and follows the required structure.
